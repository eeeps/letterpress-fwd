<h2>Project No. 1</h2>

<h3>A modern, accessible user experience for an irreplaceable letterpress community</h3>

<p>Starting with <a href="https://briarpress.org">Briar Press</a>, and then turning to other aging websites, Letterpress Forward will safeguard and restore electronic letterpress resources that are at risk of disappearing.</p>

<p>Collaborating with members of the printing community and a proficient technical team, we’ll provide Briar Press with technical and financial stability, paired with an accessible user interface that functions across different platforms and is readable by people with varying color vision.</p>

<h3>The back story</h3>

<p>
In 1995, we launched a website dedicated to saving letterpress-era machinery—the printing presses that enabled knowledge empowerment and information equality during the Renaissance through the Enlightenment and into the Industrial Age.
</p>

<p>
Nearly thirty years later, the community that has grown up around <a href="https://briarpress.org">Briar Press</a> is thriving. But the website, which contains irreplaceable historical and technical knowledge contributed by countless printers—many of them renowned, some no longer living—has become obsolete. The loss of this historical record and present-day resource is likely without intervention.
</p>

<p>
We created Letterpress Forward to restore and sustain Briar Press, along with other endangered online printing history resources, and are currently working through the initial steps of setting up the foundation.
